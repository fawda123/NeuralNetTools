This is the development repository for the NeuralNetTools package.  Functions within this package can be used for the interpretation of neural network models created in R, including functions to plot a neural network interpretation diagram, evaluation of variable importance, and a sensitivity analysis of input variables. 

The current release can be installed from CRAN:

```r
# install NeuralNetTools
install.packages('NeuralNetTools')
```

The development version of this package can be installed from [r-universe](https://fawda123.r-universe.dev):

```r
# enable repos
options(repos = c(
    tbeptech = 'https://fawda123.r-universe.dev',
    CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# install NeuralNetTools
install.packages('NeuralNetTools')
```
